AI DUNGEON STORY STORAGE ENGINE
USER GUIDE (NON-CODER FRIENDLY)

==================================================
WHAT THIS ENGINE IS
==================================================

This engine is a WORLD STATE MANAGER.

It does NOT write the story.
It does NOT replace the AI.
It quietly keeps track of:
- Where you are
- Who is present
- The mood and danger level of the world
- How player actions change the setting over time

Think of it like a stage manager in a play.
The actors (the AI) still perform, but the lights, mood, and scenery are adjusted automatically.

--------------------------------------------------
IMPORTANT CONCEPT (VERY IMPORTANT)
--------------------------------------------------

The AI CANNOT read JavaScript.
The AI ONLY reads TEXT that is injected into the story context.

The script:
1) Watches player input
2) Updates internal world state
3) Prints a SHORT, FACTUAL SUMMARY into context
4) The AI reads that summary and writes accordingly

So yes:
THE SCRIPT DOES THE HEAVY LIFTING.
Story cards and memory can stay minimal.

==================================================
WHAT HAPPENS EACH TURN (SIMPLIFIED)
==================================================

1. You type an action
   Example: "I enter the Nightjar Bar."

2. The engine reacts
   - Detects movement
   - Sets current location
   - Updates mood/state if needed

3. The engine injects context like:
   CURRENT LOCATION
   Mood
   Characters present
   Escalation level

4. The AI reads that text
5. The AI writes a scene that respects it

The AI never sees the code.
It only sees the summaries.

==================================================
WHY NOTHING HAPPENS ON TURN ONE
==================================================

On an empty scenario:
- No player input exists yet
- The engine has nothing to react to
- The AI sees an empty page

THIS IS NORMAL.

To fix this, always seed ONE of these:
- Story text
- Memory
- A short opening paragraph

Example seed:
"Rain falls over the city. A bar glows beneath neon."

Once you press Enter, the engine activates.

==================================================
WHAT YOU CAN EDIT (NO CODING REQUIRED)
==================================================

You DO NOT need to edit the script to customize your world.

You edit:
- Story text
- Memory
- Story cards (very minimal)

--------------------------------------------------
STORY TEXT (OPENING SCENE)
--------------------------------------------------

This is how the world starts.
Set tone, mood, and initial location.

Keep it short.

--------------------------------------------------
MEMORY
--------------------------------------------------

Use memory ONLY for:
- Long-term truths
- Player identity
- Major world rules

Example:
"The world hides supernatural beings from the public."

Do NOT dump lore here.

--------------------------------------------------
STORY CARDS (IMPORTANT)
--------------------------------------------------

Story cards are NOT where logic lives.
They are REFERENCE ONLY.

Because the script manages state, story cards can be SHORT.

==================================================
HOW TO WRITE STORY CARDS (MINIMAL)
==================================================

CHARACTER CARD:
- Name
- Core personality traits
- Accent or voice style
- One or two mannerisms

That is enough.
The engine enforces consistency.

LOCATION CARD:
- Name
- Type (city, bar, school, etc.)
- General vibe

The engine handles:
- Mood
- Authority
- Escalation

WORLD CARD:
- One or two rules of reality

DO NOT over-write.
DO NOT over-explain.

==================================================
INNERSELF AND THIS ENGINE
==================================================

InnerSelf is OPTIONAL.

What InnerSelf does:
- Gives NPCs internal thoughts
- Adds goals, secrets, planning
- Improves character depth

What THIS engine does:
- Tracks world state
- Tracks locations
- Tracks escalation and danger
- Injects clean context for the AI

HOW THEY WORK TOGETHER:
- This engine sets the stage
- InnerSelf handles NPC psychology

If InnerSelf is NOT installed:
- The engine still works
- No errors occur

If InnerSelf IS installed:
- The engine automatically cooperates
- Delete the very top const function of the script if you use inner self in input, output and context as only one is needed and Lewdleah uses one.
- Inner self should ALWAYS be pasted above these parts of the engine.
==================================================
WHAT THIS ENGINE AUTOMATICALLY HANDLES
==================================================

You do NOT need to manage these manually:

- Location changes
- Mood shifts
- Investigation tension
- Violence escalation
- Private/intimate space context
- World instability

Just play naturally.

==================================================
WHAT YOU SHOULD FOCUS ON AS A PLAYER
==================================================

- Roleplay naturally
- Make choices
- React emotionally
- Explore

Do NOT:
- Try to manage stats
- Worry about consistency
- Re-explain lore constantly

The engine is handling that.

==================================================
COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID
==================================================

- Overloading story cards
- Writing long lore essays
- Repeating the same facts every turn
- Expecting scripts to write prose

Scripts manage context.
AI writes prose.

==================================================
FINAL MENTAL MODEL
==================================================

You are playing a story.
The AI is writing.
The engine is remembering.

If something feels consistent, tense, and reactive:
The engine is doing its job.
