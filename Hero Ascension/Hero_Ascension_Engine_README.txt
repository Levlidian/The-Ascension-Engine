HERO ASCENSION ENGINE v1.5
Classless • Language-Driven • Player-Authored
For AI Dungeon

=================================================
README – For Players and Modders
=================================================

WHAT THIS IS
------------
The Hero Ascension Engine is a progression system for AI Dungeon that replaces
menus, classes, and skill trees with natural language play.

Your character grows based on what you describe, how often you do it, and the
intent behind your words.

There are no buttons to press.
There are no skills to select.
If you act like a hero, the system responds accordingly.

-------------------------------------------------

CORE PHILOSOPHY
---------------
• Power emerges through repetition
• Magic manifests only when intent is expressed
• Growth is earned through action, not selection
• The AI describes outcomes cinematically and realistically

You are not choosing abilities.
You are teaching the world who you are.

-------------------------------------------------

PROGRESSION OVERVIEW (PLAYERS)
------------------------------

LEVELS, XP, AND RANK
• XP is gained automatically through actions such as fighting, training,
  casting, practicing, or battling.
• Level requirements scale naturally.
• Your Rank progresses from E to SSS.
• Rank influences narrative weight and ascension eligibility.

You never type “level up”.
Progress happens invisibly when earned.

-------------------------------------------------

MAGIC THROUGH INTENT
--------------------
Magic does NOT activate because you say “I cast a spell.”

Magic activates when you express intent using language such as:
• channel
• focus
• surge
• invoke
• release
• weave
• gather

When intent is paired with elemental language (fire, shadow, lightning, etc.),
the engine:
• Tracks elemental familiarity
• Unlocks new spells over time
• Expands your magical vocabulary naturally

The more you use an element, the more fluent you become.

-------------------------------------------------

ELEMENTAL BIAS
--------------
Repeated elemental expression builds bias.

Once an element dominates your actions:
• It becomes your dominant element
• Your narration tone subtly shifts
• Your power begins to behave differently

Fire feels volatile.
Water feels adaptive.
Shadow feels controlled.
Gravity feels inevitable.

The world starts reacting to who you are becoming.

-------------------------------------------------

WEAPON SKILLS
-------------
Weapon mastery is never proven by menus.

If you:
• slash
• parry
• strike
• bash
• shoot

Then the system may unlock weapon techniques that reflect:
• precision
• momentum
• defense
• brutality
• control

Your combat style becomes readable to the AI.

-------------------------------------------------

HYBRID TECHNIQUES
-----------------
When you combine:
• magical intent
• weapon actions

The engine may generate a Hybrid Technique:
• Named from your wording
• Stored permanently
• Representing your signature move

This is how legendary techniques are born.

-------------------------------------------------

ASCENSION
---------
At SS Rank, you reach a threshold.

You are not forced to ascend.

Typing:
• archmage → ascension through mastery
• legend → ascension through myth and deeds

Ascension mutates how your dominant element behaves, creating endgame power
that feels fundamentally different.

-------------------------------------------------

STORY CARDS AND MEMORY
----------------------
The engine maintains a “Hero Chronicle” story card containing:
• Level, Rank, XP
• Known magic
• Weapon skills
• Hybrid techniques
• Ascension path

This keeps the AI consistent and prevents ability hallucination.

The system remembers so the AI doesn’t have to guess.

-------------------------------------------------

AI RULES ENFORCED
----------------
• The AI must not invent unearned abilities
• Magic feels unstable if intent is unclear
• Physical actions remain mundane without magic
• Combat includes resistance, exhaustion, and consequence

Failure is allowed.
Partial success is encouraged.
Spectacle is earned.

-------------------------------------------------

MODULAR DESIGN (MODDERS)
-----------------------
The engine is fully modular.

You can toggle:
• Magic systems
• Weapon skills
• Hybrid techniques
• Ascension
• Story card creation
• Elemental bias tracking

Magic schools, XP curves, ranks, and triggers are all editable.

This engine is meant to be extended, forked, and reskinned without breaking
its core philosophy.

-------------------------------------------------

WHO THIS IS FOR
---------------
• Players who want organic growth
• Writers who prefer show, don’t select
• Modders who want depth without UI
• Worlds where power feels earned

If you want a system that listens to how you play instead of what you click,
this engine is doing exactly that.
