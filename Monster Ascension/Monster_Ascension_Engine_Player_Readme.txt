MONSTER ASCENSION ENGINE v3.0 PLAYER & MODDER README (AI DUNGEON)

WHAT THIS ENGINE IS The Monster Ascension Engine is a persistent
evolution system for AI Dungeon where your actions shape what you
become. You begin as a monster. Not a class. Not a hero. A creature.

As you act, the engine tracks: - XP, Levels, and Rank - Physical
mutations tied to your origin - Adaptive mutations from survival and
combat - Scar mutations from injury - Nemesis hunters who survive
encounters - Humanoid Drift, representing restraint and identity

All of this is visible on the Self Appraisal Story Card.

STORY CARDS Self Appraisal: Continuously updates with your current
state: - Origin - Evolution Line - Rank and Level - XP progress -
Mutations - Humanoid Drift traits - Active Nemeses

Nemesis Escalation: Appears when enemies survive you and begin hunting
you. Shows escalation tier, hunter personalities, and world pressure.

HOW EVOLUTION WORKS You do not manually choose mutations. They occur
based on: - Combat - Injury - Survival - Time and Rank

Mutations are semi-random and influenced by your behavior.

HUMANOID DRIFT Humanoid Drift represents the monster developing thought,
restraint, and identity.

Actions that can grant drift: - talk - speak - negotiate - reason -
protect - spare - hesitate - listen - refuse

Actions that remove drift: - slaughter - massacre - devour - feast -
tear apart - maul

Drift is gained slowly and lost easily through brutality.

ASCENSION At SS Rank, ascension becomes available.

Type: - demon lord : Ascend through dominion, fear, and command - titan
: Ascend through size, endurance, and inevitability - Or refuse and
continue playing normally

Refusing ascension increases Humanoid Drift. Once chosen, ascension is
permanent.

SUGGESTED KEYWORDS Combat: attack, fight, kill, rend, tear, devour

Injury: wounded, burned, maimed, broken, scarred

Survival: escaped, retreated, survived

Social / Humanoid: talk, speak, negotiate, protect, spare, hesitate,
refuse

EDITING THE ENGINE Safe to edit: - Text, descriptions, probabilities -

DESIGN PHILOSOPHY This engine rewards consistent behavior over time. You
are not choosing alignment. You are revealing what you are becoming.

COMPATIBILITY Compatible with AI Dungeon, Inner-Self, Auto Cards, and
long-running saves.

FINAL NOTE If unsure what you are becoming, check the Self Appraisal
card. It reflects your actions honestly.
