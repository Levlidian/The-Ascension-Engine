MONSTER ASCENSION ENGINE v3.4
Comprehensive README (AI Dungeon)

============================================================
OVERVIEW
============================================================
Monster Ascension Engine v3.4 is a fully narrative-driven progression system
designed for AI Dungeon. You play as an evolving monster whose form, instincts,
and role in the world change over time.

The system emphasizes:
- Organic evolution through action
- Mutation-driven abilities
- Seasonal and time-based world pressure
- Reactive nemesis hunters
- Ascension into Demon Lord or Titan paths
- Compatibility with InnerSelf for stable long-form play

This engine uses NO hard stats, damage numbers, or mechanical combat rules.
Everything is expressed through narrative pressure and Story Cards.

------------------------------------------------------------
REQUIRED COMPATIBILITY
------------------------------------------------------------
✔ AI Dungeon scripting system (Modifiers)
✔ Story Cards enabled
✔ InnerSelf enabled (recommended, optional but supported)

InnerSelf is detected automatically. No additional setup is required.

============================================================
INSTALLATION (AI DUNGEON)
============================================================

1. Open your AI Dungeon scenario or adventure.
2. Go to:
   Edit Adventure → Scripting → Modifiers
3. Create a NEW Modifier.
4. Copy and paste ALL PARTS of the script (PART 1 through PART 5)
   in order into the modifier.
5. Save.

IMPORTANT:
- Do NOT split the script across multiple modifiers.
- Do NOT remove or reorder parts.
- The engine initializes automatically on first input.

============================================================
STARTING THE ENGINE
============================================================

When the game begins, your creature is unformed.

You will be prompted to declare your origin.

Use the following format (required):

[Origin: Wolf]
[Origin: Ghoul]
[Origin: Demon]
etc.

Valid origins include:
Wolf, Black Hound, Ghoul, Barrow Revenant, Stone Golem,
Stonebound Warden, Ent, Wraith, Serpent, Large Spider,
Chimera, Skin-Stealer, Fey Abomination, Drake, Ash Drake,
Demon, Night Warden, Bog Horror, Plague Host, Deep Wyrm

Once chosen, your origin is LOCKED.

============================================================
PROGRESSION & EVOLUTION
============================================================

Progression is automatic and narrative-based.

You gain experience every turn:
- Violent or decisive actions grant more XP
- Passive or exploratory actions grant less XP

As you level:
- Rank increases (E → SSS)
- Size increases naturally
- Mutations unlock
- New abilities emerge

There are THREE mutation types:
1. Origin Mutations (thematic, identity-defining)
2. Adaptive Mutations (reactive, survival-driven)
3. Scar Mutations (earned through injury and hardship)

Mutations are shown in Self Appraisal with:
- Description
- Linked ability
- Ability explanation

============================================================
ABILITIES
============================================================

Abilities are narrative tools, not buttons.

Examples:
- ambush: Attacks from concealment
- rend: Tearing, slicing attacks
- terror: Induces fear and panic
- regenerate: Wounds close unnaturally
- omen: Signals inevitable danger

Abilities:
- Appear automatically
- Are reinforced by mutations
- Are always explained in Self Appraisal

============================================================
SELF APPRAISAL (STORY CARD)
============================================================

A Story Card titled "Self Appraisal" updates automatically.

It contains:
- Origin
- Evolution Line
- Rank & Level
- XP progress
- Abilities with descriptions
- All mutations with ability links
- Humanoid drift status
- Active nemeses

You NEVER need to manage this manually.

============================================================
TIME SYSTEM & COMMANDS
============================================================

Time advances automatically every few turns.

Time affects:
- Narrative tone
- Hunter behavior
- Blood moon events
- Seasonal evolution bias

You may ask for the time IN CHARACTER.

Valid time commands include:
- what time is it
- check the time
- sense the time
- feel the hour
- mark the passing
- how late is it
- how early is it
- what hour is it
- what watch is it
- listen to the world
- listen to the dark
- listen to the wind

At night:
- Time becomes instinctual, not numerical
- Predatory language replaces clocks

============================================================
BLOOD MOONS & OMENS
============================================================

Blood moons occur rarely at night.

Effects:
- Heightened aggression
- Omen-heavy narration
- Stronger instinctual pressure
- Nemesis personality reactions

Different nemesis personalities react differently to blood moons.

============================================================
SEASONS
============================================================

The world cycles through four seasons:
Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter

Seasonal effects:
- Winter favors scar mutations and endurance
- Summer favors adaptive mutations and growth
- Autumn balances preparation and decay
- Spring favors renewal and adaptation

Hunters also change tactics by season.

============================================================
NEMESIS & HUNTERS
============================================================

Nemeses are recurring hunters created when enemies escape.

They have:
- Names
- Titles
- Personalities
- Tactical approaches

Nemesis escalation tiers:
Tier I – Lone Hunter
Tier II – Coordinated Pursuit
Tier III – Organized Hunt

Hunters respond to:
- Time of day
- Seasons
- Blood moons
- Your evolution path

============================================================
CREATING A PLAYER NEMESIS
============================================================

You may manually create a nemesis IN CHARACTER.

Commands:
nemesis name: Valcerin
nemesis personality: methodical

Valid personalities:
relentless
methodical
vengeful
zealous
pragmatic

Player-created nemeses fully participate in:
- Seasonal behavior
- Blood moon reactions
- Counter-adaptations

============================================================
HUNTER COUNTER-ADAPTATIONS
============================================================

As you evolve, hunters adapt narratively.

Examples:
- Targeting old scars
- Deploying wards against Demon Lords
- Using siege tools against Titans

These are narrative pressures only.

============================================================
HUMANOID DRIFT
============================================================

Repeated humanoid actions cause drift:
- Speaking
- Negotiating
- Protecting
- Sparing

As drift increases, you may gain:
- Speech
- Disguise
- Rulership

Excessive brutality can reverse drift.

============================================================
ASCENSION
============================================================

At Rank SS, you may ascend.

Choices:
- demon lord → dominion, influence, fear
- titan → mass, inevitability, endurance
- refuse → remain unaligned

Ascension permanently alters:
- Time perception
- Hunter behavior
- World reaction

============================================================
IMPORTANT NOTES
============================================================

- Do not try to min-max. The engine is narrative-first.
- Let the AI describe consequences.
- Do not invent mechanics.
- Trust the Story Cards.

============================================================
TROUBLESHOOTING
============================================================

If the engine does not respond:
- Ensure ALL script parts are pasted in order
- Ensure Story Cards are enabled
- Ensure modifier saved successfully

InnerSelf compatibility:
- Fully supported
- No configuration required
